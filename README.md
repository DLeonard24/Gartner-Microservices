Microservices have many benefits but come with a lot of costs that should be considered before business owners look for change. The biggest benefit of microservices is the scalability, reducing down time by creating more instances when traffic is high, and destroying excess to not waste resources when demand is low. They also give advantages in continous deploymeny, when a monolith goes down from a bug, it takes everything with it. With microservices however, only the broken service is taken down for fixing, while the rest of the application can stay up. Because microservises are small, this increases the complexity of the issue, and is the reason why many businesses who attempt to use microservices fail. Switching to a MSA requires new designs, new workers to service containers, and experts to coordinate everything, all of which can be very costly.
